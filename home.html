                 information to provide the service and to improve the Apple TV app for you and others.We also collect information 

                 about your purchases, downloads, activity in the Apple TV app, the content you watch, and where you watch it to tailor

                 this purpose, as described below.

                 App Store, Apple News, and Stocks, where available, are relevant to you. You have choices with respect to this advertising,

                 or emails you send and receive, will be used to compute a device trust score when you attempt a purchase. The submissions are 

                 designed so Apple cannot learn the real values on your device. The scores are stored for a fixed time on our servers.

                 Apple TV allows you to watch your favorite TV shows and movies all in one place. You can watch content you have rented or 

                 purchased from Apple. If available, you can also access content through Apple TV+, Apple TV channels, and your connected 

                 third-party video apps. You can access all of this content through the Apple TV app across supported devices that are signed
                 
                 in to the same Apple Account.Providing the Apple TV App
                
                We use your personal data to provide the services and features in the Apple TV app. This information includes your account and payment information, which you can access and change in Settings.
                
                Apple collects information about what you purchase and what you’re watching in the Apple TV app on any supported devices signed in to the same Apple Account. Apple stores this information associated with your Apple Account so we can display what you’re watching across your supported devices. When you sign in to third-party apps, information about whether you have subscribed to those services is used to display content available to you. If you grant permission for a third-party app to be connected to the Apple TV app, Apple will collect and store information about what you watch from that app on any of your supported devices, as well as your subscription status. Apple apps with supported content, such as Apple Music and Remote, will be automatically connected when you start using the Apple TV app.
                
                Information about what you’re watching will include what content you’re playing, when you played it, the device you played it from, and where in the content you paused or stopped watching. We also collect a detailed history of all playback activity for Apple TV channels and Apple TV+.
                
                If you allow the Apple TV app to access your location, your location will be used to determine what’s available in your region, including local content like live games, events, and news. Some content includes geographically relevant ads.
